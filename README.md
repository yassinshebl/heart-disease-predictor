## 1. Project Overview

This project utilizes the UCI Heart Disease dataset and includes:

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (PCA)  
- Supervised and unsupervised ML models  
- Model evaluation and tuning  
- Deployment with **Streamlit**  
- Public sharing using **Ngrok**

## 2. Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine  
- KMeans (for unsupervised learning)
